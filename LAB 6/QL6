Experiment 9: Create a record of 10 employee which contains following information: emp_id., 
emp_name, and age. Create a C++ (OOPs concept) program to search an employee with its emp_id.


Experiment 10: (friend function with inline function, friend function with another class)
Implement Two Class name is class_2,class_1 define one function name is exchange this function work in 
both class properties. friend function can be called by reference in this case copies of the object are not 
made. Instead a pointer to the address of the object is passed 


Experiment 11: (Dynamic memory allocation with new, delete, and destructor)
A Program to allocate contiguous memory for an array using the new operator and the object of the array 
is destroyed by the delete operator.


Experiment 12: (Operator Overloading)
Design a class named vector to model a one-dimensional array with integer elements.
Overload the followimg operators to perform the intended task:
(i) Operator ‘<<’ to output a vector object.
(ii) Operator ‘>>’ to input a vector object in the form [10, 20, 30, . . .].
(iii) Operator ‘+’ to add two vector objects.
(iv) Operator ‘-‘ to subtract a given vector object from another vector object.
