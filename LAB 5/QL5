Experiment 5: Assume that a publishing company markets prints books and digital books (electronic 
form – CD’). Create a class named Publication with data members named title, price, and author’s name. 
From Publication class, derive two classes named Book and Ebook. The Book class adds a page count data 
member named pcount while Ebook adds data member playing time name ptime. Each of these classes 
must have member function getDatd() to read class specific data from keyboard and displayData() to 
output the class specific data to the computer screen. Write a program to test these classes.


Experiment 6: Write a program to find mean of two numbers belonging to two different classes using 
friend function.


Experiment 7: Write C++ program to calculate area of a cuboid. Convert the cuboid into a cube using a 
friend class.


Experiment 8: Write a C++ Program to implement the arithmetic operations multiplication on complex 
numbers using the concept of this pointer, inline functions and scope resolution operator.
